# Factory Inspection Microcontrollers Assembly

The purpose of this project is to create an automated factory inspection system using hardware and more specifically Microcontrollers ATmega16. In this system we have 3 main parts of the assembly line in the factory that need to communicate with each other. - Originally developed 27/03/2018



## What was developed in this project
1. Build the general infrastructure in Assembly for the communication of the machines
2. Create a robust system that can self-asses and never stops even if an error occurs
3. Create a communication environment between the system and the user

## What I learned from this Project
It was an amazing introduction to Assembly and in general the world of micro controllers. It was a realy good transition from Arduino and RaspberryPi projects to the world of low level micro controllers. 

## Which was the project difficulty 
It was mainly the language that it was built upon
